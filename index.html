                <p>Hello there! As you probably already know, my name is Frank Marino, and it is a pleasure to meet you.
                    Before I get into my college experience, here is a bit of background about my life. I am from south
                    Florida, specifically Pembroke Pines and have lived there my whole life. When I was 5 years old I 
                    started playing tennis and played for roughly 16 years. I played competitively for about 11 years 
                    (7 to 18) and still play with some good players and friends at my college. I loved tennis so much I
                    became homeschooled in 6th grade up until college to make more time for training. This gave me 5 
                    hours a day, Monday through Friday with tournaments on the weekends. I enjoyed the grind, but around
                    18 it was time to decide what degree to major in. Video games and technology such as smartphones
                    peaked my interest, so I started with computer engineering. After my first year I realized software 
                    was what I was after, and changed my major to Computer Science. A few years later, here I am now as a 
                    senior at <abbr title="Florida State University">FSU</abbr> majoring in Computer Science. I am taking 
                    my last class to get my bachelor's and will graduate at the end of this summer, 2024. With the time I
                    have spent here, I have really enjoyed this degree. Last summer was my favorite since I finally had
                    a taste of real development. I had a full-stack development class with C# and made android apps in a 
                    mobile application development class with java. I also took a few classes this spring that were 
                    full-stack with python and really loved it. Full-stack, front-end, and back-end are my favorite aspects 
                    of coding. Below you can see my projects with descriptions of each!</p>
